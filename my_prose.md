In this song, K3 sings about gender roles.

Finally, another controversial song like Doe Maar (one of my favorites)!

I think it shows that K3 does not only think that hair color (e.g. De Aarde Beeft) or skin color (e.g. Alle Kleuren) are unimportant, but also add gender to the list. They sing about gender roles [1], being born in a body of the other gender [2] and female homosexality [4].

Ironically, K3 may have contributed to gender problematics with some of their earlier songs. The prime example is Jongens Zijn Gek, meaning 'boys are crazy', in which they emphasize the difference between the genders, widening the gap between the sexes and is, expectedly, most favorable of the female sex. Other examples of supporting the traditional gender roles are in Mijn Liefje Achterna, in which they go after a boy on a pink scooter, and Jodelee, in which they write a love letter on pink paper.

I am happy to hear the word 'Superman' again in a K3 song. Up until now, only Papapa mentioned a superman (which is ambiguous if this refers to just a superb human or our hero from Krypton) and I hope for more references to superheroes, like batman or spiderman. As a minor note: there is a song called Superhero I which K3 sings about being superheroes themselves), which I also enjoy.

A point of recurring critique (as already in Wie Zal Ik Een Kusje Geven) is the phrase 'Het laat me berenkoud' [3], which translates to 'I do not care'. I think K3 should always care. And I think K3 does care. This sentence is probably left in only for rhyming purposes. I would suggest to replace it with 'Ik vind het altijd goud'. 'Goud' is the way 'good' is pronounced in Groningen. Because Klaasje is from Groningen, I'd suggest to let her sing that phrase.

It is to be expected that K3 will sing about female homosexuality [4] as their main audience is female. I also think it fits K3 better than singing out male homosexuality. I assume most K3 listeners can extrapolate the message of this song to understand that male sexuality is also fine.

Great song and one of my instant favorites.
